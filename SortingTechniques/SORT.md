 
1. **Sorting Methods**:
   - Imagine you have a bunch of numbers all mixed up, and you want to arrange them in order from smallest to largest. 
   - There are different ways to do this sorting, like bubble sort, insertion sort, and selection sort. Each method has its own way of putting the numbers in order.

2. **Bubble Sort**:
   - It's like going through the numbers one by one and swapping them if they're in the wrong order, like bubbling the smallest number to the top.
   - This process repeats until all the numbers are in the right order.

3. **Insertion Sort**:
   - Imagine you have a bunch of cards in your hand, and you want to arrange them in order. 
   - You pick up one card at a time and put it in the correct position among the cards you've already sorted.

4. **Selection Sort**:
   - You look at all the numbers and pick the smallest one. Then you put it in the first position.
   - Next, you look at the remaining numbers and pick the next smallest one, and put it in the second position.
   - You keep doing this until all the numbers are in order.

5. **Timing the Sorting**:
   - After learning how to sort, we want to know how long each sorting method takes to sort the numbers.
   - We use a clock to measure the time it takes for each sorting method to finish sorting.

6. **Testing**:
   - We test our sorting methods by giving them lists of numbers to sort, and then we see how long each method takes to sort the numbers.
   - We do this multiple times to make sure the results are consistent.
