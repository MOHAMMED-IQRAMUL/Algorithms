# Greedy Algorithms Module

Welcome to the Greedy Algorithms Module! This module is dedicated to showcasing implementations of greedy algorithms in various programming languages, including C, C++, Java, and Python. Greedy algorithms are known for making locally optimal choices at each step with the hope of finding a global optimum solution.

## Overview

Greedy algorithms are a fundamental concept in computer science and optimization problems. This module aims to provide a comprehensive collection of greedy algorithm implementations, covering a wide range of problems such as scheduling, optimization, and graph traversal.

## Contents

The module contains programs implemented in different programming languages, allowing you to explore and compare implementations across languages. Here's what you'll find in this module:

- **C**: Greedy algorithm implementations in the C programming language.
- **C++**: C++ implementations of greedy algorithms, including standard template library (STL) usage where applicable.
- **Java**: Java implementations showcasing the application of greedy algorithms in various problem domains.
- **Python**: Python implementations of greedy algorithms, focusing on readability and simplicity.
