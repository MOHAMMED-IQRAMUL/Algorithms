# Knapsack Greedy Algorithms Module

Welcome to the Knapsack Greedy Algorithms Module! This module is dedicated to showcasing implementations of greedy algorithms for solving knapsack problems in various programming languages, including C, C++, Java, and Python. 

## Overview

Knapsack problems are classic optimization problems where items with certain values and weights need to be selected to maximize the total value while not exceeding a given weight capacity. Greedy algorithms provide heuristic approaches to solve knapsack problems efficiently, making locally optimal choices at each step.

## Contents
